Predicting Heart Attacks with BRFSS data from CDC


This report has two sections. First, a data exploration and second the creation of machine learning
algorithms to predict heart attacks.

We use three algorithms

*KNN
*Naive Bayes
*Decision Trees

Note: This was a project for school, and these algorithms were what was specified to use.
